# Smart-IoT-Blockchain-Security-By-Using-Shuffled-Random-Starvation-Link-Encryption
 As rapid digitization of healthcare sector safeguarding confidential personal medical informa
tion has emerged as an important issue of concern. Centralized architectures typical of tradi
tional Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems expose them to data breaches, unauthorized
 disclosure, and privacy breaches. To counter these threats this project introduces a blockchain
based platform for secure Personal Health Records (PHR) management with a novel two-level
 encryption strategy inspired by the Shuffled Random Starvation Link Encryption (SRSLE)
 model. The system leverages Ethereum smart contracts developed in Solidity and deployed via
 Remix IDE providing a decentralized, transparent and tamper-resistant platform for the stor
ing of an encrypted health data. A user-friendly HTML/JavaScript frontend, integrated with
 MetaMask and Web3.js enables patients to upload encrypted PHR data apply on-chain hash
ing for additional security and manage their records independently.Ownership verification is
 strictly enforced through wallet-based authentication and all interactions with the blockchain
 are immutably logged through event emissions. Our solution enables single and batch uploads
 of PHRs via .txtfilesandoffers real-time monitoring of gas usage, block confirmations
 and execution timestamps to guarantee transparency and auditability. Testing and auditing
 prove that the system maintains patient privacy has strict access control and offers complete
 transparency of data use. Additions like transaction detail visibility and Excel export enhance
 usability and trust. While the existing implementation puts emphasis on foundational function
ality it also provides the foundation for further improvements in the future, such as AI-driven
 sensitivity classification, off-chain storage through IPFS, and role-based access control.
